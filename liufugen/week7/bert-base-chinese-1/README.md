# Model Details
- **Model Description:**
This model has been pre-trained for Chinese, training and random input masking has been applied independently to word pieces (as in the original BERT paper).

- **Developed by:** HuggingFace team
- **Model Type:** Fill-Mask
- **Language(s):** Chinese
- **License:** [More Information needed]
- **Parent Model:** See the [BERT base uncased model](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased) for more information about the BERT base model.


## Uses
